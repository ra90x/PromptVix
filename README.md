# ðŸ“ˆ PromptVix - AI-Powered Data Visualization Platform

University of Liverpool | MSc Dissertation Project | Developed by Ramz A.

PromptVix is a Streamlit-based application that compares how different Large Language Models generate data visualizations from natural language prompts. The platform allows users to evaluate visualization outputs from multiple AI models and provide structured feedback on their effectiveness for business intelligence tasks.

## Overview

This research tool investigates the capabilities of contemporary LLMs in generating meaningful business visualizations. The application supports three leading models: DeepSeek v3.1, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, enabling direct comparison of their visualization generation approaches.

## Key Features

### Multi-Model Comparison
The platform simultaneously generates visualizations from three different AI models, allowing for direct comparison of their outputs. Each model processes the same prompt independently, providing insights into varying approaches to data visualization tasks.

### Business Problem Library
The application includes 18 pre-defined business scenarios with varying complexity levels:

- Basic problems: Simple bar charts and pie charts for fundamental business questions
- Intermediate problems: Multi-dimensional scatter plots, stacked charts, and treemaps
- Advanced problems: Complex heatmaps, network analysis, and correlation studies

### Custom Prompt Support
Users can input their own natural language requests for visualizations, testing the models' ability to interpret and respond to novel prompts beyond the pre-defined scenarios.

### Comprehensive Feedback System
The platform collects structured feedback on three key dimensions:

- Visual accuracy and clarity
- Insightfulness of generated visualizations
- Business relevance and applicability

Feedback data is stored in Supabase for subsequent analysis and research purposes.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with separate components for prompt handling, visualization generation, feedback collection, and data management. The core visualization logic processes natural language prompts and generates executable Python code using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly libraries.

### Data Processing
The platform works with CSV datasets, with a sample Superstore dataset included for demonstration purposes. Users can upload custom datasets to test model performance across different data domains.

### Model Integration
AI models are accessed through the OpenRouter API, which provides unified access to multiple LLM providers. Each model receives identical prompts and dataset context, ensuring fair comparison conditions.


## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenRouter API key
- Supabase account (for feedback storage)

### Installation

### Installation Steps

1. Clone or download the project repository
2. Install required Python packages:
//pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure environment variables in a .env file:

//OPENROUTER_API_KEY: Your OpenRouter API key
//SUPABASE_URL: Database connection URL
//SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Database access key


4. Launch the application:
//streamlit run app.py


The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Guide

### 1. Dataset Management
- Default Dataset: Superstore_Dataset.csv (included)
- Custom Upload: Support for any CSV file
- Data Preview: First 10 rows displayed automatically

### 2. Visualization Generation

#### Option A: Pre-defined Business Problems
Select from 18 carefully crafted business scenarios:
- Easy: Basic bar charts, pie charts (Problems 1-6)
- Medium: Scatter plots, stacked charts, treemaps (Problems 7-15)
- Complex: Heatmaps, network graphs, correlation analysis (Problems 16-18)

#### Option B: Custom Prompts
Write your own visualization requests in natural language:

"Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between sales and profit, 
with point size representing quantity and color representing category"
```

### 3. Model Comparison
- Simultaneous Generation: All 3 models process your request concurrently
- Tab-based Results: Each model gets its own dedicated tab
- Side-by-side Comparison: Easy evaluation of different approaches
- Code Transparency: View and analyze generated Python code

### 4. Feedback Collection
For each model output, provide comprehensive feedback:
- Visual Accuracy (1-5): Clarity, formatting, appropriate chart type
- Visual Insightfulness (1-5): Value of insights gained
- Business Relevance (1-5): Alignment with business objectives
- Iteration Count: Number of refinements needed
- Outcome Classification: Select positive/negative aspects
- Comments: Detailed observations and suggestions
